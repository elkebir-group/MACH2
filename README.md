# MACH2

MACH2 is a computational tool for inferring optimal migration histories of metastatic cancer from clonal trees and observed clone locations. It supports multiple parsimony criteria, including the *unobserved clone criterion*, and guarantees optimality and completeness by systematically enumerating solutions.

## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- **Python** - `MACH2` requires Python 3.12 .
- **ILP solver** - `MACH2` requires an ILP solver installed. Currently `MACH2` only supports `Gurobi optimizer` (version 12 or newer), but we are going to add support for more ILP solvers in the future. `MACH2` requires a valid Gurobi installation and license key. The location of Gurobi should be present in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (linux) or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS), and the license key should be saved in the environment variable `GRB_LICENSE_KEY`.
- **OS** - Since MACH2 is a pure Python package, it can be run on any operating system that supports Python.

MACH2 has been tested with Python 3.12 and Gurobi optimizer version 12 on CentOS 7.

### 1.2 Install using `pip`

`MACH2` can easily be installed using `pip`, the package installer for Python.
Gurobi python package also needs to be installed separately.
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

                $ pip install gurobipy
                $ pip install mach2

If you want to install `MACH2-viz` along with `MACH2`, you can run the following commands instead:

                $ pip install gurobipy
                $ pip install 'mach2[viz]' 

`MACH2-viz` can be installed separately too.

### 1.3 Install using `conda`

`MACH2` can be installed using `conda` from the channel `bioconda`. We advise to create a new environment in `conda`.

                $ conda create -n mach2 python=3.12 gurobi mach2 -c gurobi -c bioconda

If using existing conda environment, the following command installs MACH2 and Gurobi.

                $ conda install gurobi mach2 -c gurobi -c bioconda

### 1.4 Install from source

Since MACH2 is a python package, one may clone the repository and install from source using `pip`.

                $ git clone https://github.com/elkebir-group/MACH2.git
                $ cd MACH2
                $ pip install .

In any approach, MACH2 takes less than 5 minutes to install on a normal computer with regular internet speed.

## 2. Usage Instruction

### 2.1 I/O formats

We describe various formats used by `MACH2`.

1. **Tree file** : The tree file contains a list of edges that define the structure of a tree. Each line in the file represents an edge, and the edges should be in the format: `node1 node2`. For example:

        1   2
        2   3
        2   4 
        3   5

2. **Tree file with timing/comigrations** : Tree file with timestamps. Edges with the same timestamp belong to the same comigration, and a timestamp with `-1` represents non-migration. Each line corresponds to an edge in the format: `node1 node2 timestamp`. For example:

        1   2   -1
        2   3   1
        2   4   1
        3   5   2

3. **Observed labeling file** : The observed labeling file contains zero or more location labels assigned to each node of the input clonal tree. Each line in the file corresponds to a node and the labels assigned to it in the format: `node label1 label2 ...`. If a node is not observed anywhere, it may be skipped. For example:

        1   A   B
        3   B
        4   A   C
        5   C

4. **Location labeling file** : The location labeling file contains the unique location label of origin assigned to each node. Each line in the file corresponds to a node and the location label of origin are in the format: `node label`. For example:

        1   A
        2   B
        3   C

5. **Node of origin file** : The node of origin file maps the nodes of the refined tree to the nodes of the input clonal tree. Each line in the file corresponds to a vertex and the labels are in the format: `leaf label`. For example:

        1   A
        2   B
        3   C
        
Additionaly, `MACH2` can output files in Graphviz DOT format or JSON format.

### 2.2 Usage

`MACH2` takes as input two files - 

1. **Tree file** : Tree file describing the input clone tree.
2. **Observed labeling file** : Labeling file describing the observed labeling of input clone tree.


`MACH2` Can be run using command line, or can be directly accessed from `JupyterLab`.

#### 2.2.1 From JupyterLab

`MACH2` can be directly imported and accessed from JupyterLab. 
We include an [example JupyterLab notebook][https://github.com/elkebir-group/MACH2/blob/main/analysis/example.ipynb] to illustrate basic usage.
The notebook runs in less than one minute on a normal computer.
For more details, check the documentation for classes and methods.


#### 2.2.2 From Terminal


For each solution, `MACH2` can output three types of files.

1. **Tree file with timing/comigrations** : Refined tree file with timestamps/comigrations.
2. **Location labeling file** : Location labeling file describing the location labeling of the refined tree.
3. **Node of origin file** : Node of origin file mapping refined tree nodes to input clonal tree nodes.

Additionaly `MACH2` can return JSON file encoding all the solutions. The JSON file can be directly passed to [MACH2-viz](https://github.com/elkebir-group/mach2-viz). The exact format of the JSON file is described [here](https://github.com/elkebir-group/mach2-viz/README.md).

`MACH2` also prints `<primary location> <number of migrations> <number of comigrations> Optimal <running time (in seconds)>` on console.

`MACH2` can be run using python.

An example execution

For this specific instance, MACH2 takes less than one second to run on a normal computer.

## 3. Reproduction

We include a [JupyterLab notebook](https://github.com/elkebir-group/MACH2/blob/main/analysis/run.ipynb) containing relevant codes to run MACH2 (and also the other migration history inference methods) on all the simulated and real data and generate the results presented in the preprint.
